 # System-verilog
This repository contains a comprehensive collection of SystemVerilog projects, tutorials, and learning resources aimed at digital design, verification, and DFT (Design for Test) techniques. The projects and examples are suitable for both beginners and advanced learners in the VLSI domain.



# üìö Learning Plan: #100DaySystemVerilog

This repository aligns with a 100-day structured learning plan, covering topics from SystemVerilog fundamentals to advanced UVM (Universal Verification Methodology) techniques. The detailed plan includes:

Weeks 1-2: SystemVerilog Basics, Module Design, and Simple Testbenches

Weeks 3-4: Data Structures, OOP Concepts, and Parameterized Design

Weeks 5-6: Testbench Creation, Verification Techniques, and UART Design

Weeks 7-8: Advanced Verification and Protocol Design (e.g., AMBA AHB/AXI)

Weeks 9-10: UVM Testbenches, SoC Module Verification, and Regression Testing

Weeks 11-12: Complex Protocols, IP Core Verification, and Reusable UVM Agents

Weeks 13-14: Processor Core Design, SoC Component Verification, and Final Projects
